# LibOps Sites

Here you will find all you need to know about creating and managing your site on LibOps.

## Create an account on LibOps

Before creating a site on LibOps you must first create an account. You can do so on [the LibOps registration page](https://www.libops.io/user/register). Please note: you must register on LibOps with a non-free email account. LibOps is only intended to be used by institutions needing Islandora hosting. If you need an exception for this, please [contact us](mailto:info@libops.io).

After you register, you will need to verify your email address. Check your email for an invitation from LibOps.

## Create your site

Now that you're registered and verified your email, you're ready to [create a site on LibOps](https://www.libops.io/site/create).

Visiting that URL will automatically create an Islandora 2 site for you and assign you as the owner.

You will also be invited as a contributor to the GitHub repository that houses the code for the site.

## Access your site

After you've created a site on LibOps you'll be able to view the URLs to all your site environments on [your LibOps account page](https://www.libops.io/user).

You can also find the URLs in your GitHub repository.
